You should express what you want a model to do by \

specific as you can possibly make them. \ 
This will guide the model towards the desired output, \

or incorrect responses.

- Land costs $100 / square foot
- I can buy windmills for $200 / square foot

Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.

So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal \
sale for around $50 in the month of November, about \
half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) \
around the second week of December the prices all went \
up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same \
system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or \
so in price also from the earlier sale price of $25. \
So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part \
where the blade locks into place doesn't look as good \
as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I \
plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush \
very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \ 
blender first then pulverize them in the serving size \
I want in the blender then switch to the whipping \
blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \
first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade \
if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making \
smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and \
vegetables that you plan to use that way you can avoid \
adding so much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. \
After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. \
I called customer service but the warranty expired \
already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall \
